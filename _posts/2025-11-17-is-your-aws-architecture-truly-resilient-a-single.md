Relying on multiple Availability Zones within one AWS region is a good start, but it's not enough. A full regional outage, while rare, presents a catastrophic business risk that single-region architectures cannot mitigate.

True resilience requires thinking beyond regional boundaries. A multi-region strategy is a critical insurance policy for mission-critical services where downtime is not an option.

Consider a core service like authentication. An active-active multi-region deployment ensures that if one region fails, traffic seamlessly routes to the other. This prevents a total outage, protecting revenue and customer trust.

The key is strategically identifying which services warrant the added complexity and cost. It's a crucial trade-off between operational overhead and business continuity.

Evaluate your core services against this risk. Don't wait for an outage to expose the gaps.
