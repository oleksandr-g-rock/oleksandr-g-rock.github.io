When you have dozens of microservices, managing individual CI/CD pipelines becomes a significant operational burden. The goal is to enable team autonomy without creating chaos.

The core tension lies between centralized governance and decentralized execution. How do you enforce security scanning, compliance checks, and deployment best practices across all services consistently?

A powerful approach is creating shared pipeline templates or libraries. A central platform team provides a "paved road" of pre-configured stages for building, testing, and deploying.

Service teams consume these templates, gaining speed and ensuring compliance by default. This model can reduce pipeline setup time from days to minutes, while standardizing critical security gates across the organization.

This balances autonomy with control, a critical factor for scaling engineering organizations effectively.
