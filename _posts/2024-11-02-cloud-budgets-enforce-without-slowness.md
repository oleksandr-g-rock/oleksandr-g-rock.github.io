Most companies learn about budget overruns **after** they’ve already blown past them.  
By then, it’s too late — the money is spent.

The real challenge is enforcing cloud budgets *proactively* without slowing down engineering teams.

## 🔹 The mistake many teams make
Adding approval gates, tickets, and meetings.  
This kills engineering momentum.

## 🔹 The better path: Automated guardrails
Embed cost estimation directly inside CI/CD workflows.

When a new resource or infrastructure change is proposed:
- the pipeline estimates its cost  
- compares it to the team’s budget  
- flags the PR if it exceeds thresholds  

This turns FinOps into a **shift-left practice**, empowering engineers with real-time cost insights.

## 🔹 The result
- Fewer surprises  
- Better cost-value conversations  
- No performance penalty for teams  
- Transparent accountability  

FinOps works best when it is **automation first** — not finance-first.
